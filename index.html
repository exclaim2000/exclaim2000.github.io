I'm back here again</a></h2><p>I’m back. And I’m not proud of it. I haven’t written a posr since June. Meanwhile I quit my job after only 4 months. The pressure was not good. The fit was terrible and it hurt like hell to stay at that job. I realize I knew what I was in for from the beginning. I should of listened to myself and not ignored the warning signs. But it is done. But I am back here.</p><h2><a href="/2018/06/21/staying-focused.html">Staying focused</a></h2><p>The challenge for me now is not blowing up. Everything seems to be getting under my skin. I’ve got a new job and I am struggling to comprehend and store everything into my brain that needs to be. I continuously feel like I’m letting my boss down, though I think that may be his personality of crazy high expectations and lack of patience. Maybe, maybe not.</p><h2><a href="/2018/06/19/back-at-the-start-again.html">Back at the start... again</a></h2><p>Yah I’m back where I didn’t want to be. I got trashed every day this weekend. I suffered big time and my girlfriend saw it. She saw right through this bullshit this time. No getting around it. I was having massive anxiety attacks from my drinking and I couldn’t hide it. I was freaking out! No good.</p><h2><a href="/2018/05/21/things-look-up.html">Things look up</a></h2><p>Well they’re starting to. There was some more tears last night. I was on edge all day and exploded yet again. So bad to see the effect that I’m having over this beautiful girl that totally deserves to be treated better than I am treating her. I don’t know why she is putting up with my bullshit but she is.</p><h2><a href="/2018/05/20/wow-intense.html">Wow, intense</a></h2><p>My brain is going to explode. Seriously. I am full of anxiety, anger and frustration. If you could bottle up an atomic bomb inside of a human, that would be me right now. I don’t know how to contain myself. I am just looking for opportunities to argue with my girlfriend. Looking for a fight with her. Whatever she does or says, I am instantly on top of her and pushing her down. Figuratively speaking that is.</p><h2><a href="/2018/05/19/ground-zero-of-may-15th.html">Ground Zero of May 15th</a></h2><p>So I stopped drinking since May 15th. Given the fact that it is the 19th of May right now, that is not such an achievement. I rather want to put this out there so I can keep track of the fact that I started on May 19th. I hope this is to be the last day I stopped drinking. I am sure there will be some challenges up a head of me.</p><h2><a href="/2018/05/16/so-fucked.html">So fucked</a></h2><p>So fucked. I am messed up. I was perpetually hung over and drunk since last Thursday. Now I’m back. I had to go to work 6 times out of the 20 since I’ve started my new job. The new job that I promised myself that I wouldn’t drink and have a smash at. The one I promised myself I wouldn’t let myself down. The one that I promised I would have no regrets. I’m at the peak of my career thus far and I don’t know how I got here with the level of disappointment I’ve let myself grow to.</p><h2><a href="/2018/05/03/i-failed.html">I Failed</a></h2><p>I Failed. Second day in…. and now the third day in. It has been rough and I just wanted to take my mind off things. Well that’s what I’m doing now. I should mention I caved quite easily last night when I met up with my old coworkers. Just two beers. I felt fine in the morning, maybe could of done with more sleep.</p><h2><a href="/2018/05/01/its-may.html">It's May</a></h2><p>So it’s May. I need to get through this month without hitting any booze. Straight off the bat I am meeting with ex-colleagues tomorrow night. No doubt they will want to have a few beers to catch up with me. So I’ll just need to use the excuse “no sorry, I am driving”.</p><h2><a href="/2018/04/30/no-good.html">No good</a></h2><p>I relapsed. Hard. I went camping with my girlfriend. There was a tipping point where I chose to drink one beer over lunch. That turned into another beer, which subsequently ended with us buying wine, a 6 pack and another tall beer. Lets just say there was not much left over the next morning. I feel sick, dissapointed in myself and this really feels like I have no control.</p><h2><a href="/2018/04/28/im-exploding.html">I'm exploding</a></h2><p>The stress is getting to me. I’m not coping well. I’m blowing up at the littlest of things and it is killing me. I’m not sure why I have such a short fuse but I do. Not great. Not good.</p><h2><a href="/2018/04/27/its-the-boredom.html">It's the boredom</a></h2><p>It most clearly is. I can’t operate with this brain of mine. It operates at a frequency that is painful. It can’t stop. It can’t slow. It needs to be occupied or forecibly slowed. If I just sit alone, or have no agenda I get antsy. I get bored, tired of myself. Tired of listening to podcasts, of reading, or reading news or scrolling the infinite scroll of social media. It’s tiring and its because of boredom.</p><h2><a href="/2018/04/26/so-what-now.html">So What Now?</a></h2><p>I haven’t been thinking of drinking lately. That feels good. I’ve either been too wrapped up in work, or occupied with other areas in my life. I think part, if not all, of my brain needs to adjust to this change however. Something isn’t right. I am still getting snappy and not keeping my cool. I understand that alcohol and drinking changes the physiology of your brain if you expose it to enough drinking habits for a prolonged period of time.</p><h2><a href="/2018/04/24/well-im-here.html">Well. I'm here?</a></h2><p>I have been here a while. I mean forward and backward from this position. This position of not knowing what is going to happen to me. See I keep slipping into this darkness. I am addicted. As hard as that as for me to write. I don’t know if it is conditioning of marketing, of social pressures. Or I don’t know if it is genetics. I don’t know if it is a habit that has formed due to my environment. All I know if that I keep finding myself in this position and it sucks.</p><h2><a href="/2018/04/24/bubblegum.html">I Don’t Need To Chew Bubblegum</a></h2><p>Is pretty much like saying you have an issue and are compelled to chew chewing gum. This internal voice of mine. That I need to have something. Is going away. There’s no point crossing off the days on the calendar since your last drink. All you’re doing there is really affirming to yourself that you are missing something. You are neglecting an internal power that is compelling you to do something. That voice has to go.</p></div></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>by someone.</small></p></footer></body></html>
