I'm here?</a></h2><p>I have been here a while. I mean forward and backward from this position. This position of not knowing what is going to happen to me. See I keep slipping into this darkness. I am addicted. As hard as that as for me to write. I don’t know if it is conditioning of marketing, of social pressures. Or I don’t know if it is genetics. I don’t know if it is a habit that has formed due to my environment. All I know if that I keep finding myself in this position and it sucks.</p><h2><a href="/2018/04/24/so-what-now.html">So What Now?</a></h2><p>I’m not really sure. There was a myth of being productive in the unproductive action of just drinking when I got home. I saw it as a way of relaxing. Turning my brain off for the day.</p><h2><a href="/2018/04/24/bubblegum.html">I Don’t Need To Chew Bubblegum</a></h2><p>Is pretty much like saying you have an issue and are compelled to chew chewing gum. This internal voice of mine. That I need to have something. Is going away. There’s no point crossing off the days on the calendar since your last drink. All you’re doing there is really affirming to yourself that you are missing something. You are neglecting an internal power that is compelling you to do something. That voice has to go.</p></div></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>Developed by <a href="http://webjeda.com">webjeda</a></small></p></footer></body></html>
