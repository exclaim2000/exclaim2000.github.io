You know what they have there. Two drink minimums. Also going with friends that can be quite challenging. But I don’t have to drink.</p><p>My brain has been absolutely scattered this week though. Hardly able to focus, retain or recall any information. I think it is trying to find its feet, but also probably damaged to some degree. That is really sad. You have this fresh outlook on life, but part of you knows that you have been impaired by your past actions to some degree. I mean, of course we are all impaired or enriched by our past actions. The time lost doing productive tasks, time spend instead drinking on the couch watching mindless tv.</p><p>I am pretty sure I would be married by now. A relationship fell apart in the past that went on for 5 years. Until my bullshit corroded what we had. The venom that I spit out was too much for the relationship to endure. I feel a lot of the same symptoms creeping up in this relationship right now. Time to act. I would be idiodic, well I already am to drink so much, but for me to allow history to repeat. Let’s do it!</p><p>No. More. Drink!</p></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>by someone.</small></p></footer></body></html>
