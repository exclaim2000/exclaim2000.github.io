There was some more tears last night. I was on edge all day and exploded yet again. So bad to see the effect that I’m having over this beautiful girl that totally deserves to be treated better than I am treating her. I don’t know why she is putting up with my bullshit but she is.</p><p>So we had another fight about some petty shit. Some stuff that I really should of just let go and not even broached. Approached in a more mature way. My line of work really demands patience from me. To a degree I really am a lot more patient than I am at home. Maybe my threshold is reached and I unleash at home all the pent up whateverness from work.</p><p>Things are better today though. I am much more at peace. I am a lot more respectful and just super happy today. I had a great time with my Boss and team mates, so over all it was excellent. I want this to keep up. There was a point in today that rarely happens. I smiled based on how the day was going.</p><p>I could vividly picture how I operated if I was hungover. Which was only a week ago. But I was slumped, boring, mopey and just not a nice person. Today. Sunshine.</p></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>by someone.</small></p></footer></body></html>
