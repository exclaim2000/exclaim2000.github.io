Seriously. I am full of anxiety, anger and frustration. If you could bottle up an atomic bomb inside of a human, that would be me right now. I don’t know how to contain myself. I am just looking for opportunities to argue with my girlfriend. Looking for a fight with her. Whatever she does or says, I am instantly on top of her and pushing her down. Figuratively speaking that is.</p><p>I just want to relax and be happy. But I feel this stress and this restlessness inside of me. No one is good enough. No one understands me or can communicate with me. Everyone rightfully is distancing themselves from my impatience and unwillingness to let them come near me.</p><p>The strange thing now is though. I don’t even want to drink. It hasn’t really compelled me. It hasn’t even been a week. But I am not seeking out alcohol. Don’t be fooled reader. I’ve been at this stage many a time. I know exactly what is around the corner. This current state of feeling anxious and restless is the very stage before being comfortable. The stage of being comfortable is where I foolishly tell myself that I am okay.</p><p>Yes. I am okay. I am allowed to have a beer with a friend. But only one. That I am okay to drink, as long as I don’t bring any home. No alcohol at home, but keep it social. Then it goes from there to, well. It is Friday. I don’t have plans and everyone else is busy. Why not let yourself have a drink? At which point I hobble down to the store to buy a 6 pack. Which follows the next day with me going back to the store to buy 2 six packs.</p><p>This is the cycle that I must break. This is a challenging point for me and everyone around me. This restlessness is destroying. I have to find a way to come out of this one okay.</p></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>by someone.</small></p></footer></body></html>
