So I hope I helped them out from just an hours work. But I am happy I could fix that up. This morning I also kicked off an old project. I am going to rewrite it in a new language so I can ramp back up on skills for the new job.</p><p>Oh yeah. I signed up to a new job. It’s in an industry that I’ve really passionate about. The team is truly amazing, passionate and excited to have me on board. I am very excited that I could join. They really pulled out all the stops to get me to sign on. Which is a great sign.</p><p>Anyhow. I am continuing to read the soberista’s book. I am looking forward to finishing it. Not because it’s a bad read. But because there is a follow up book from it that is more of a practical guide to kicking the drink after 6 weeks. Let’s see. I can’t remember the last 6 month gap I had in drinking.</p><p>Yay.</p></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>by someone.</small></p></footer></body></html>
