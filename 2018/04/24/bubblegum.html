<p>Is pretty much like saying you have an issue and are compelled to chew chewing gum. This internal voice of mine. That I need to have something. Is going away. There’s no point crossing off the days on the calendar since your last drink. All you’re doing there is really affirming to yourself that you are missing something. You are neglecting an internal power that is compelling you to do something. That voice has to go.</p>

<p>The voice has to go so that I can truly be free of this burden. I no longer am trying not to drink. No. I just am. Like a problem that does not exist. Like me not needing to state that I am not compelled to chew chewing gum. I am not striking out the calendar each day that I don’t chew chewing gum. Nope. So that is what it is for me with alcohol now.</p>

<p>Well. I was not a heavy drinker in the sense I never hit spirits. But I have come to learn, and what I had tricked myself into previously, is that means jack shit. See I was slain to beer. I thought it was a drink that was healthier than a massive influx of toxins from spirits. What I failed to capture was how much beer I truly was consuming. It was horrendous. The hangovers would of been just the same with hard alcohol.</p>

<p>But here I am. Not, not allowing, just not having.</p>
